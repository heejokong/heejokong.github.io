I am a graduated student pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Brain & Cognitive Engineering at Korea University, South Korea, and a member of [Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning Lab](http://pr.korea.ac.kr/) advised by Prof. Seong-Whan, Lee.

I am interested in exploring ways to enhance the practicality and reliability of machine learning systems for deployment in real-world applications.

For further details, please refer to my [CV]().
